            <div class="process-steps">
                <div class="process-step">
                    <h3>1. Initial Consultation</h3>
                    <p>The free initial consultation is an informal discussion with you, the homeowner, looking to undertake the project. This can be a daunting process so communication is key. During the initial consultation we will discuss what you would like to achieve from the proposed development and the feasibility of the project. We can talk through various design approaches and suggest the best solutions moving forward.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-step">
                    <h3>2. Measured Survey</h3>
                    <p>If you decide to proceed then the next step is a measured survey. This is a site visit where we can produce an accurate representation of your property. This will usually take up to an hour and during this visit we can discuss your brief in detail. Depending on the scope of the works required the measured survey will usually include the following: floor plans, elevation, basic sections, roof plans, and site layout.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-step">
                    <h3>3. Sketch Designs</h3>
                    <p>We always provide clients with several sketch designs to show the different ways the space can be utilized. We typically produce 3 different options based on the brief and tend to find that our clients like different elements from each. We will discuss the different options at a design meeting and amend the plans accordingly to ensure you are happy with the final design.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-step">
                    <h3>4. Planning Application</h3>
                    <p>Planning consent is required for the majority of residential projects. However, in some instances, a planning application may not be necessary due to Permitted Development Rights. During the initial consultation, we will discuss the need for a planning application. If it is necessary, we will submit an application for a Certificate of Lawfulness which will certify that the proposed development is lawful and within your permitted development rights.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-step">
                    <h3>5. Building Regulations</h3>
                    <p>Once we have obtained the necessary planning consent or certificate of lawfulness, we will prepare the building regulation package. The drawing package is required by the council to ensure that the development is being built in accordance with building regulations. We provide quality and detailed plans which can be used on site for construction. This will include cross sections, foundation details, steel and joist layouts, insulation and drainage sections. These drawings can be used to obtain competitive quotes from builders.</p>
